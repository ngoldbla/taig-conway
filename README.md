## What is Conway's Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. Despite simple rules, it produces complex, fascinating patterns.

### Rules
1. Any live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
3. All other cells die or stay dead
